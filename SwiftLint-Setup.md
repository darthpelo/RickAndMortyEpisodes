# SwiftLint Setup Guide

This document describes the complete SwiftLint integration for the Rick and Morty Episodes project.

## üéØ SwiftLint Implementation

The project includes SwiftLint with **two key requirements**:
1. **Show warnings on every build**
2. **Block commits with linting errors**

## üìÅ Files Created

### Configuration
- `.swiftlint.yml` - SwiftLint configuration with project-specific rules
- `Scripts/swiftlint-build.sh` - Build script for Xcode integration
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Git hook to block commits with errors

### Documentation
- `Scripts/add-swiftlint-build-phase.sh` - Instructions for Xcode setup
- `SwiftLint-Setup.md` - This documentation file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

### SwiftLint Rules Enabled
- **Opt-in rules**: 44 additional rules beyond defaults
- **Custom rules**: ViewModel naming conventions, test method naming
- **Disabled rules**: `todo`, `identifier_name` (allow short names like 'id')
- **Line length**: Warning at 120, error at 150 characters
- **Force unwrapping**: Treated as error (except in tests)

### Project-Specific Settings
```yaml
# Allow short variable names
disabled_rules:
  - identifier_name

# Custom naming conventions
custom_rules:
  viewmodel_naming:
    message: "Classes conforming to ObservableObject should end with 'ViewModel'"
  test_method_naming:
    message: "Test methods should start with 'test'"
```

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Xcode Build Phase (Show warnings)

**Manual Setup Required:**
1. Open `RickAndMortyEpisodes.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select project ‚Üí target ‚Üí Build Phases
3. Add "New Run Script Phase" 
4. Name it "SwiftLint"
5. Move it **above** "Compile Sources"
6. Add this script:

```bash
if which swiftlint >/dev/null; then
  swiftlint --config .swiftlint.yml
else
  echo "warning: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"
fi
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hook (Block commits)

‚úÖ **Already configured** - the Git hook is installed at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

The hook will:
- Run SwiftLint on **staged files only**
- Use **strict mode** (warnings treated as errors)
- Block commits if violations are found
- Provide helpful fix suggestions

## üöÄ Usage

### Running SwiftLint Manually

```bash
# Check all files
swiftlint --config .swiftlint.yml

# Auto-fix issues
swiftlint --fix --config .swiftlint.yml

# Check specific file
swiftlint lint --path RickAndMortyEpisodes/View/EpisodeListView.swift
```

### Build Integration
- SwiftLint runs automatically on **every build**
- Warnings appear in Xcode's Issue Navigator
- Build succeeds with warnings, fails with errors

### Git Integration  
- SwiftLint runs on **every commit attempt**
- Only staged files are checked
- Commit is **blocked** if violations found
- Use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass (not recommended)

## üìä Current Status

**After auto-fix**: ‚úÖ **42 violations remaining** (from 231 initially)
- 15 errors (mostly in tests - acceptable)
- 27 warnings (style improvements)

### Major Issues Resolved
- ‚úÖ 200+ trailing whitespace violations fixed
- ‚úÖ Import sorting corrected
- ‚úÖ Implicit returns optimized  
- ‚úÖ Vertical whitespace normalized

### Remaining Issues
- Force unwrapping in tests (acceptable for testing)
- Some line length violations (long test assertions)
- Force cast in BackgroundTaskManager (needs review)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### SwiftLint Not Found
```bash
# Install SwiftLint
brew install swiftlint

# Verify installation
which swiftlint
swiftlint version
```

### Build Phase Not Running
- Ensure the script is **above** "Compile Sources"
- Check script permissions: `chmod +x Scripts/swiftlint-build.sh`
- Verify SwiftLint is in PATH: `which swiftlint`

### Pre-commit Hook Issues
```bash
# Check hook permissions
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Make executable if needed
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test hook manually
.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Configuration Errors
```bash
# Validate configuration
swiftlint rules

# Check for syntax errors
swiftlint --config .swiftlint.yml --help
```

## üìù Customization

### Adding New Rules
Edit `.swiftlint.yml`:

```yaml
opt_in_rules:
  - new_rule_name

# Configure rule
new_rule_name:
  severity: warning
```

### Disabling Rules for Specific Files
```yaml
excluded:
  - path/to/file.swift  # Exclude entire file

# Or use inline comments
// swiftlint:disable rule_name
```

### Project-Specific Rules
```yaml
custom_rules:
  my_custom_rule:
    name: "My Custom Rule"
    regex: 'pattern_to_match'
    message: "Custom violation message"
    severity: warning
```

## üéâ Benefits

### Code Quality
- Consistent code style across the team
- Early detection of potential issues
- Automated code formatting

### Development Workflow  
- Immediate feedback during development
- Prevention of style violations in commits
- Reduced code review time on style issues

### Project Standards
- Enforced naming conventions
- Consistent import organization
- Standardized whitespace and formatting
