# Rick and Morty Episodes App

A SwiftUI iOS application that displays episodes from the popular Rick and Morty TV series using the official Rick and Morty API. This app demonstrates modern iOS development practices, MVVM architecture, SOLID principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and comprehensive localization support.

## 🌍 Localization Support

This app supports **Dutch (nl)** and **English (en)** localization with full date formatting support:
- All user-facing strings are localized using String Catalogs (.xcstrings)
- **Date formatting automatically follows system locale** (dates display correctly in Dutch/English based on system language)
- Dynamic language switching (follows system language)
- Localized error messages and UI components
- Professional Dutch translations included
- **Resolved**: Month names now display correctly in the selected system language

## 📱 Project Overview

This iOS app was developed to meet the requirements of an iOS Senior Developer position assignment. It provides a comprehensive view of Rick and Morty episodes using the official [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest), with advanced features like background refresh, data persistence, and export functionality.

## 🤖 Development Approach & AI-Assisted Development

**Important Note on Development Tools**: I have been working for over a year at a company that actively encourages the use of GitHub Copilot as a development support tool. For more than a year now, having an IDE with generative AI that supports and accelerates my development and learning has become an integral part of my workflow.

**For this assignment**, I utilized **GitHub Copilot** and **Cursor IDE with Claude-4-Sonnet** as development assistance tools for specific purposes:

### **AI Assistance Usage**:
- **Code Autocompletion**: Enhanced code completion and boilerplate generation
- **SwiftUI Code Improvement**: As I haven't been writing UI code regularly in the past year, particularly SwiftUI, I leveraged AI assistance to ensure modern SwiftUI best practices and patterns
- **Comprehensive Test Creation**: AI assistance was used to generate and structure all unit tests, ensuring thorough coverage across ViewModels, Services, and business logic
- **Project Review & Alignment**: Used AI to review the entire project against the assignment requirements, ensuring all functional and technical requirements were properly implemented

### **My Core Contributions**:
- **Architecture Design**: Complete MVVM architecture with SOLID principles implementation
- **Background App Refresh Strategy**: BGTaskScheduler implementation approach and technical decisions
- **API Integration Design**: Network layer architecture and error handling strategies  
- **Business Logic**: All core application logic and data flow management
- **Problem-Solving**: Technical challenges resolution and optimization decisions

This approach allowed me to focus on **senior-level architectural decisions** and **system design** while ensuring code quality, comprehensive testing, and adherence to modern iOS development standards, despite not working regularly with UI development in recent months.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### MVVM Pattern Implementation
The application follows a strict **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│    View     │◄──►│  ViewModel   │◄──►│    Model    │
│  (SwiftUI)  │    │ (ObservableObject)│    │ (Structs)   │
└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

**Views** (SwiftUI):
- `EpisodeListView`: Main episodes list with pagination and pull-to-refresh
- `EpisodeDetailView`: Episode details with character list
- `CharacterDetailView`: Character information with JSON export functionality

**ViewModels** (ObservableObject):
- `EpisodeListViewModel`: Episodes management and background refresh
- `EpisodeDetailViewModel`: Episode detail logic
- `CharacterDetailViewModel`: Character details and export functionality
- `CharacterDetailLoaderViewModel`: Character loading state management

**Models** (Structs):
- `Episode`: Episode data structure
- `Character`: Character data structure  
- `EpisodeResponse`: API response wrapper

### Background App Refresh Implementation

**True Background Refresh** using `BGTaskScheduler`:
- **Task Identifier**: `com.rickandmorty.episodes.refresh`
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Self-rescheduling background tasks
- **Background Execution**: Fetches new episodes while app is backgrounded
- **Cache Updates**: Updates local persistence without UI interference
- **System Integration**: Respects iOS background execution policies

**Key Components**:
- `BackgroundTaskManager`: Centralized BGTaskScheduler handling
- `performBackgroundRefresh()`: Optimized background execution method
- Info.plist configuration for background modes

### Services Layer

**APIService**: 
- HTTP networking using URLSession
- Async/await pattern for modern concurrency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rick and Morty API integration

**CacheService**:
- UserDefaults-based persistence
- Generic caching mechanism
- Data integrity validation
- Automatic corruption recovery

### Localization Architecture

**String Management**:
- `Localizable.xcstrings`: String Catalog with Dutch + English translations  
- `LocalizationHelper.swift`: Centralized localized string access
- Dynamic format strings for parameterized text
- Complete UI and error message localization

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests Coverage
- **EpisodeListViewModelTests**: ✅ All scenarios including background refresh
- **EpisodeDetailViewModelTests**: ✅ Complete coverage
- **CharacterDetailViewModelTests**: ✅ All character loading scenarios

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### SOLID Principles Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has one reason to change
- `APIService`: Only handles API communication
- `CacheService`: Only manages data persistence
- ViewModels: Only handle presentation logic for their specific view
- `BackgroundTaskManager`: Only manages background task scheduling

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- Protocol-based architecture allows easy extension
- `EpisodeFetcher` and `EpisodeCache` protocols enable different implementations
- `CharacterFetcher` protocol supports multiple character sources

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes must be substitutable
- Mock implementations fully substitute real services in tests
- `MockEpisodeFetcher` and `MockEpisodeCache` maintain behavior contracts

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No forced dependencies on unused methods
- Small, focused protocols (`EpisodeFetcher`, `EpisodeCache`, `CharacterFetcher`)
- ViewModels only depend on needed protocol methods

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- ViewModels depend on protocol abstractions
- Dependency injection enables testability and flexibility

### API Integration
- **Base URL**: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api`
- **Endpoints**: Episodes (`/episode`), Characters (`/character/{id}`)
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented with proper error handling
- **Pagination**: Automatic next page loading
- **Networking**: Modern async/await pattern

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms with user feedback
- **Parsing Errors**: Graceful fallbacks and error reporting
- **Cache Corruption**: Automatic recovery and refresh
- **Background Task Errors**: Proper error logging and task rescheduling

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Episodes loaded on demand with pagination
- **Image Caching**: Character images cached efficiently  
- **Background Updates**: Non-blocking background refresh
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and weak references

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Bonus Features (Implemented)
- ✅ **Persistence Mechanism**: Data saved locally with cache
- ✅ **Pull to Refresh**: Refresh mechanism via drag gesture

**Note**: UI tests were not implemented due to time constraints, with focus placed on comprehensive unit test coverage and core functionality.

### Export Functionality
- **JSON Export**: Character details exported as formatted JSON
- **iOS Share Sheet**: Native sharing integration
- **File System**: Temporary file creation and management

### Background Processing
- **BGTaskScheduler**: iOS 13+ background task framework
- **Task Scheduling**: Intelligent rescheduling based on usage patterns
