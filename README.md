# Rick and Morty Episodes iOS App

A SwiftUI iOS application that displays Rick and Morty episodes with character details, built following MVVM architecture and SOLID principles.

## 📱 Project Overview

This iOS app was developed to meet the requirements of an iOS Senior Developer position assignment. It provides a comprehensive view of Rick and Morty episodes using the official [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest), with advanced features like background refresh, data persistence, and export functionality.

## 🤖 Development Approach & AI-Assisted Development

**Important Note on Development Tools**: I have been working for over a year at a company that actively encourages the use of GitHub Copilot as a development support tool. For more than a year now, having an IDE with generative AI that supports and accelerates my development and learning has become an integral part of my workflow.

**For this assignment**, I utilized **GitHub Copilot** and **Cursor IDE with Claude-4-Sonnet** as development assistance tools for specific purposes:

### **AI Assistance Usage**:
- **Code Autocompletion**: Enhanced code completion and boilerplate generation
- **SwiftUI Code Improvement**: As I haven't been writing UI code regularly in the past year, particularly SwiftUI, I leveraged AI assistance to ensure modern SwiftUI best practices and patterns
- **Comprehensive Test Creation**: AI assistance was used to generate and structure all unit tests, ensuring thorough coverage across ViewModels, Services, and business logic
- **Project Review & Alignment**: Used AI to review the entire project against the assignment requirements, ensuring all functional and technical requirements were properly implemented

### **My Core Contributions**:
- **Architecture Design**: Complete MVVM architecture with SOLID principles implementation
- **Background App Refresh Strategy**: BGTaskScheduler implementation approach and technical decisions
- **API Integration Design**: Network layer architecture and error handling strategies  
- **Business Logic**: All core application logic and data flow management
- **Problem-Solving**: Technical challenges resolution and optimization decisions

This approach allowed me to focus on **senior-level architectural decisions** and **system design** while ensuring code quality, comprehensive testing, and adherence to modern iOS development standards, despite not working regularly with UI development in recent months.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Language**: Swift 5.0+
- **Minimum iOS**: 13.0+ (for BGTaskScheduler support)

### Key Components

#### Models
- `Episode`: Episode data structure
- `Character`: Character data structure with complete API mapping
- `EpisodeResponse`: API response wrapper with pagination info

#### ViewModels
- `EpisodeListViewModel`: Episodes list management and background refresh
- `EpisodeDetailViewModel`: Episode detail display logic
- `CharacterDetailViewModel`: Character detail management
- `CharacterDetailLoaderViewModel`: Character data loading coordination

#### Services
- `APIService`: Network layer with async/await
- `CacheService`: Data persistence and offline support
- `BackgroundTaskManager`: BGTaskScheduler management

#### Views
- `EpisodeListView`: Main episodes list with infinite scroll
- `EpisodeDetailView`: Episode details with character IDs
- `CharacterDetailView`: Character information display

### Background Refresh Implementation
```swift
// BGTaskScheduler configuration
Task Identifier: "com.rickandmorty.episodes.refresh"
Background Modes: ["background-fetch"]
Registration: During app launch
Execution: System-managed background execution
```

### Data Persistence
- **Cache**: Episodes and characters cached locally
- **Offline Support**: App works with cached data when offline
- **Storage**: UserDefaults for simple data, JSON encoding for complex structures

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests Coverage
- **EpisodeListViewModelTests**: ✅ All scenarios including background refresh
- **EpisodeDetailViewModelTests**: ✅ Complete coverage
- **CharacterDetailViewModelTests**: ✅ All character loading scenarios
- **APIServiceTests**: ✅ Network layer testing
- **CacheServiceTests**: ✅ Persistence layer testing

### Test Types
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- ✅ **Mock Testing**: Simulated API responses
- ✅ **Background Refresh Tests**: BGTaskScheduler functionality

**Note**: UI tests were not implemented due to time constraints. The focus was placed on comprehensive unit test coverage and core functionality implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🎯 SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `APIService`: Only handles network requests
- `CacheService`: Only handles data persistence  
- `BackgroundTaskManager`: Only handles background task management
- Each ViewModel handles only its specific view logic

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Protocol-based architecture allows extension without modification
- New data sources can be added via protocol implementation

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Mock implementations are fully substitutable with real implementations
- Protocol conformance ensures behavioral consistency

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- `EpisodeFetching`, `EpisodeCaching`, `CharacterFetching` are separate, focused protocols
- Clients depend only on methods they actually use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions (protocols)
- Dependency injection used throughout the app
- Easy to test and modify dependencies
